The goal is to write a program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports (via print) whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number.
To do this, we're using Luhn's algorithm. According to the algorithm, you can determine if a credit card number is (syntactically) valid as follows:
  Multiply every other digit by 2, starting with the number’s second-to-last digit, and then add those products’ digits together.
  Add the sum to the sum of the digits that weren’t multiplied by 2.
  If the total’s last digit is 0 (or, put more formally, if the total modulo 10 is congruent to 0), the number is valid!
To determine which type of credit card it is, we're taking advantage of the fact that:
  American Express uses 15-digit numbers, MasterCard uses 16-digit numbers, and Visa uses 13- and 16-digit numbers
  American Express numbers start with 34 or 37; most MasterCard numbers start with 51, 52, 53, 54, or 55 and all Visa numbers start with 4.
