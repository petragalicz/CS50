The goal is to implement a program that identifies a person based on their DNA.

Background:

DNA is a sequence of molecules called nucleotides, arranged into a particular shape (a double helix). Each nucleotide of DNA contains one of four different bases: 
adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or thymine (T). Every human cell has billions of these nucleotides arranged in sequence. 
Some portions of this sequence (i.e. genome) are the same, or at least very similar, across almost all humans, 
but other portions of the sequence have a higher genetic diversity and thus vary more across the population.

One place where DNA tends to have high genetic diversity is in Short Tandem Repeats (STRs). 
An STR is a short sequence of DNA bases that tends to repeat consecutively numerous times at specific locations inside of a person’s DNA. 
The number of times any particular STR repeats varies a lot among individuals. 
Using multiple STRs, rather than just one, can improve the accuracy of DNA profiling. CODIS, FBI’s DNA database, uses 20 different STRs as part of its DNA profiling process.

The CS50 staff has provided sequences of DNAs and two CSV file containing STR counts for a list of individuals.

The .txt files of sequences of DNAs contains the STRs:
AAGGTAAGTTTAGAATATAAAAGGTGAGTTAAATAGAATAGGTTAAAATTAAAGGAGATCAGATCAGATCAGATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCAGAAAAGAGTAAATAGTTAAAGAGTAAGATATTGAATTAATGGAAAATATTGTTGGGGAAAGGAGGGATAGAAGG

The DNA database is in a CSV file, wherein each row corresponds to an individual, and each column corresponds to a particular STR:
name,AGAT,AATG,TATC
Alice,28,42,14
Bob,17,22,19
Charlie,36,18,25

So the program should take a sequence of DNA and a CSV file containing STR counts for a list of individuals and then output to whom the DNA (most likely) belongs.
