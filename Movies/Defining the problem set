CS50 staff provided a SQLite database that stores data from IMDb about movies, the people who directed and starred in them, and their ratings. 

The database contains the following tables:

CREATE TABLE movies (
                    id INTEGER,
                    title TEXT NOT NULL,
                    year NUMERIC,
                    PRIMARY KEY(id)
                );
CREATE TABLE stars (
                movie_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
                person_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
                FOREIGN KEY(movie_id) REFERENCES movies(id),
                FOREIGN KEY(person_id) REFERENCES people(id)
            );
CREATE TABLE directors (
                movie_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
                person_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
                FOREIGN KEY(movie_id) REFERENCES movies(id),
                FOREIGN KEY(person_id) REFERENCES people(id)
            );
CREATE TABLE ratings (
                movie_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
                rating REAL NOT NULL,
                votes INTEGER NOT NULL,
                FOREIGN KEY(movie_id) REFERENCES movies(id)
            );
CREATE TABLE people (
                id INTEGER,
                name TEXT NOT NULL,
                birth NUMERIC,
                PRIMARY KEY(id)
            );

There are 13 questions to answer in this dataset using SQLite:
In 1.sql, write a SQL query to list the titles of all movies released in 2008.

In 2.sql, write a SQL query to determine the birth year of Emma Stone.

In 3.sql, write a SQL query to list the titles of all movies with a release date on or after 2018, in alphabetical order.

In 5.sql, write a SQL query to list the titles and release years of all Harry Potter movies, in chronological order.

In 6.sql, write a SQL query to determine the average rating of all movies released in 2012.

In 7.sql, write a SQL query to list all movies released in 2010 and their ratings, in descending order by rating. For movies with the same rating, order them alphabetically by title.
