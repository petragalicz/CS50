A Mystery in Fiftyville

The CS50 Duck has been stolen! The town of Fiftyville has called upon to solve the mystery of the stolen duck. Authorities believe that the thief stole the duck and then, 
shortly afterwards, took a flight out of town with the help of an accomplice. The goal is to identify:

Who the thief is,
What city the thief escaped to, and
Who the thiefâ€™s accomplice is who helped them escape
All you know is that the theft took place on July 28, 2020 and that it took place on Chamberlin Street. (source: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/psets/7/fiftyville/)

The CS50 staff provided a SQLite database to solve this problem set, which contains the following tables:
airports                  crime_scene_reports       people                  
atm_transactions          flights                   phone_calls             
bank_accounts             interviews              
courthouse_security_logs  passengers 

To solve the problem set, SQLite is used in the CS50 IDE.
