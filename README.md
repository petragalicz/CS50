# CS50
CS50 is one of the most popular introductory computer science course taught at Harvard University. I enrolled into the course online via EdX. I'm uploading my problem solutions only for the lectures on Python and SQL, as some parts of the problem sets code in C was prewrtitten by the CS50 staff.

 For coding the course uses CS50 IDE, a cloud-based integrated development environment which includes programs and features for writing code.
